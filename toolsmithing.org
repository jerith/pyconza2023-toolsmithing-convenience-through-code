* What is a toolsmith?

#+ATTR_HTML: :class heading
A person who makes tools

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
More specifically, in the context of this presentation:\\
toolsmiths build tools to improve their own productivity,\\
and that of their friends and colleagues.

** Why build tools?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
- Save time
- Reduce complexity
- Existing tools don't fit
- It's fun

#+BEGIN_NOTES
We'll go through each of these in more detail.
#+END_NOTES

** Save time

#+CAPTION: https://xkcd.com/1205/
#+ATTR_HTML: :height 500px :align center
[[./img/is_it_worth_the_time_2x.png]]

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Automation tools can save you some time. Here's a handy chart from XKCD to help you decide if it's worth it.
#+END_NOTES

** Save time?
:PROPERTIES:
:REVEAL_DATA_TRANSITION: fade-in slide-out
:END:

#+CAPTION: https://xkcd.com/1319/
#+ATTR_HTML: :height 500px :align center
[[./img/automation_2x.png]]

#+BEGIN_NOTES
But of course, it's always more complicated.
#+END_NOTES

** Reduce complexity

#+ATTR_HTML: :class heading
Simple is better than complex

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
- Get rid of boilerplate
- Focus on the things you care about
- Remove sources of error

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Boilerplate: I want to deploy an application, not write a thousand-line k8s manifest.
- Focus: Specify the things necessary for the app, let the robots do the rest.
- Errors: If you only need three parameters, don't expose the other seventeen.
#+END_NOTES

** Existing tools

#+ATTR_HTML: :class heading
The world is full of tools

Usually you can find one to meet your needs

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
Maybe you can get by with one that doesn't quite fit

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
Or you can build your own

** Fun

#+ATTR_HTML: :class heading
Happy people are productive people

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
We enjoy creative work, not tedious repetition

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
Toolsmithing is creative work that replaces tedious repetition


* Examples

#+ATTR_HTML: :class heading
Some tools I've built recently

- ~bigterm.sh~
- ~kustom-tool~
- ~filter_plan_2.py~
- ~clothsim.py~

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- ~bigterm.sh~: I promised you a tiny shell script.
- ~kustom-tool~: I promised you a moderately complex cluster configuration manager.
- ~filter_plan_2.py~: An ugly hack that saved us hours of downtime.
- ~clothsim.py~: An art project.
#+END_NOTES


* ~bigterm.sh~

#+ATTR_HTML: :class heading
Makes my terminal big

** ~bigterm.sh~ » problem

#+ATTR_HTML: :class heading
Why do I need a tool for this?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
- 80x25 isn't always enough
- But it's a pretty good default for me
- Manual resizing is inconsistent
- Manual resizing is /annoying/

** ~bigterm.sh~ » implementation

Here's the code in its entirety:

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :code_attribs data-line-numbers
#+INCLUDE: "./code/bigterm.sh" src bash

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Took me about 20 minutes, 19 of which was finding and reading the relevant documentation.
- I didn't bother making it configurable or anything.
#+END_NOTES

** ~bigterm.sh~ » results

#+ATTR_HTML: :class heading
How did it work out for me?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
- I only ever notice it on computers that don't have it
- Six point three bazillion context switches avoided
- Paid for itself in happiness the first time I used it

** ~bigterm.sh~ » lessons

#+ATTR_HTML: :class heading
What can we learn from this?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
A tiny tool that solves a tiny problem can still be a big win


* ~kustom-tool~

#+ATTR_HTML: :class heading
Cluster configuration manager

** ~kustom-tool~ » problem

#+ATTR_HTML: :class heading
Why do we need a tool for this?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
- Have you /seen/ k8s YAML‽
- Deploying other people's stuff is boring
  @@html:<span style="font-size:60%;">(and I don't want to do it)</span>@@
- Waiting for me to deploy stuff is slow
  @@html:<span style="font-size:60%;">(and they don't want to do it)</span>@@
- Focus on what's important

** ~kustom-tool~ » requirements

#+ATTR_HTML: :class heading
What does this tool need to do?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
- Static deploy manifests in the repo
- Minimal boilerplate
- Use upstream sources where practical
- Reasonably fast

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Static: What we see is what gets deployed, no surprises.
- Minimal: Get rid of all the irrelevant bits.
- Upstream: We don't want to have to reinvent existing deployments.
- Fast: Do things in parallel.
#+END_NOTES

** ~kustom-tool~ » approach

#+ATTR_HTML: :class heading
How did we go about building it?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
- Find existing tools we can use
  - ~kustomize~, ~helm~, ~ytt~, etc.
- Glue those tools together
- Build the missing pieces

** ~kustom-tool~ » design

Two stage operation:
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
- ~sources~: Fetch upstream sources
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
  - k8s manifest, archive, git, helm chart, kustomize
  - Fetches everything required to generate output
  - Only required when sources have changed
- ~regenerate~: Build deployment manifests
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
  - Calls ~kustomize~ and ~ytt~ to build output

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- manifest, archive, git: Only fetch.
- chart, kustomize: Call external tools.
#+END_NOTES

** ~kustom-tool~ » implementation

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
- Python (obviously)
- ~trio~ for concurrency
- ~mypy~ and ~ruff~ to find most of the bugs
- ~kustomize~ plugin to call ~ytt~
- 2-4 months (part time) to build
- It's "just worked" long enough that I forgot the rest

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- trio: Because it has a sensible concurrency model
- ruff: Best linter available
- kustomize: plugins are horrible
#+END_NOTES

** ~kustom-tool~ » results

#+ATTR_HTML: :class heading
How did it work out for us?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
- Deploys take minutes to prepare instead of hours/days
- Dev teams do 90% of the deploys themselves
- No YAML-related injuries since 2021
- External tools make setup somewhat annoying

** ~kustom-tool~ » lessons

#+ATTR_HTML: :class heading
What can we learn from this?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
Sometimes the tool we build is essentially a production system and should be treated as such

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
Target audience matters, especially if it's more than just you

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Production: That means tests, revision control, ongoing maintenance, etc.
- Target audience: CLI is fine. Weird setup stuff isn't ideal.
#+END_NOTES


* ~filter_plan_2.py~

#+ATTR_HTML: :class heading
Terraform plan filter

** ~filter_plan_2.py~ » problem

#+ATTR_HTML: :class heading
Why do we need a tool for this?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
- Eight (or maybe ten?) k8s clusters to upgrade
- Terraform module update with *lots* of changes
- 1k+ lines of terraform plan output
- 100+ affected resources
- At least one resource that *must* be fixed

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Clusters: 4-6 hours each.
- Module: Big refactor, they suggest recreating clusters.
- Plan: Most of an hour to go through manually, missed things.
- Fix: If missed, breaks the whole cluster.
#+END_NOTES

** ~filter_plan_2.py~ » sample input

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :code_attribs data-line-numbers="11" data-ln-start-from="1234"
#+INCLUDE: "./code/tf-plan-snippet.txt" src text

** ~filter_plan_2.py~ » design

#+ATTR_HTML: :class heading
Meh, who has time to design this

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
It's just a bunch of substring matches, right?

** ~filter_plan_2.py~ » implementation

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
- Basically just a bunch of substring matches
- Grouped into sections:
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
  - EXPECTED: Displayed for completeness
  - UNEXPECTED: Check these to make sure they're okay
  - WARN: Things that need manual fixing
- 200 lines of very hacky code, no tests, no repo

** ~filter_plan_2.py~ » results

#+ATTR_HTML: :class heading
How did it work out for us?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
- No clusters were harmed during the upgrades
- (At least, not from anything related to this)
- Spent a couple of hours working on a better version
  - Configuration was messy and difficult
  - Not worth the effort, make a new one next time

** ~filter_plan_2.py~ » lessons

#+ATTR_HTML: :class heading
What can we learn from this?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
A tool that you use once (or eight to ten times) and then throw away can still be valuable

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
A hacky prototype that gets the job done may be all you need

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Production: That means tests, revision control, ongoing maintenance, etc.
- Target audience: CLI is fine. Weird setup stuff isn't ideal.
#+END_NOTES


* ~clothsim.py~

#+ATTR_HTML: :class heading
Blender cloth simulation wrangler

** ~clothsim.py~ » problem

#+ATTR_HTML: :class heading
Why do I need a tool for this?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
- I'm making a comic, which means lots of renders
- Every panel needs cloth simulation:
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
  - Animate from default pose to desired pose
  - Save simulation results as shape keys
  - Apply shape keys and clear simulation data

** ~clothsim.py~ » implementation

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
- The same as the manual process, but automated
- Blender's APIs are made of global mutable state
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (t)
  - ... because that's what 3d modelling is
  - I still don't like it much, though
- Very incomplete, but usable

** ~clothsim.py~ » results

#+ATTR_HTML: :class heading
How did it work out for me?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
Dunno yet, art time has been limited

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
Early results are promising, though

** ~clothsim.py~ » lessons

#+ATTR_HTML: :class heading
What can we learn from this?

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
Some tools will continue to evolve forever as requirements change

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
If you try hard enough, you can find a way to show off your artwork at a tech conference

- There's more than one way to do it
  #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag t
  - Pick the one that fits the problem you're solving

#+BEGIN_NOTES
- Try: The cost of a quick hack is small.
- Fail: Half the tools I've started building never went anywhere.
